        // - For convention (good practices), its used camelCase for namimg to variables, although: "$, _ ,name_var" can be used to it.

        // - Never to use reserved words like : if, class, null. for , etc.

        /*

        Rules to define names of variables:

        - For convention, Variable names begin with a lowercase letter.
        - It must be a character set included in the Unicode unification.
        - It cannot be the same as a word (reserved from the language), or the name of a boolean value (true or false).
        - They must not have the same name as other variables whose declarations appear in the same scope.
        - If a variable is composed of more than one word, such as 'dataName' the words are put together and each word after the
        The first one,it starts with a Capital letter (camelCase).
         - They can start with a letter, an underscore "_" or a dollar sign "$", with the following characters being letters or digits.
